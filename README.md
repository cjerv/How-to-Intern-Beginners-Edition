# How to -> Intern Interview Edition
## _From a Boeing 747 pilot to a Wannabe Crypto Intern_


A brief story of how I went from flying to writing this article.

- The Crypto Rabbit Hole - Short Version
- Interning Wannabe - The Pull Request
- Research and Notes for later


## Flying

- Learnt to fly in Cessna 152, Cessna 172, and Piper Seminole PA-44
- After earning my Commercial Pilot License I became a Flight Instructor
- Moved from Instructing to flying a Boeing 727 in various roles
- Moved to Hong Kong and started flying for Cathay Pacific
- I currently fly a Boeing 747 freighter, and previously flew Airbus A330, A340 and Boeing 777 aircraft.

Flying has been something that I wanted to do as a young child.  I am blessed to have been able to achieve that dream.

As [Leonardo Da Vinci] was quoted, and found on the [Pilot Mall Blog][df2]

> “Once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, and there you will always long to return.”


## Markdown - I'm just going to leave this in...

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.
- Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
- Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
- Import and......  OK, that's enough of that

I am unabashedly copying the landing page from [Dillinger][df2].




## My First Coin


Chinese New Year 2020, was when I first realized that my aviation career might be derailed, more specifically January 27th.  Prior to heading off to Singapore, Bangkok, and Singapore, for a 4 night 3 day all expenses paid tour of SE Asia, I recall my wife handing me face masks and insisting that I wear them when walking though the busy airport terminals. I choose to politely thanks her, put the masks in my pocket and forget about them. Once we got into the terminal and mixed with many coughing transit passengers heading to Singapore for the holiday, I quickly change my thinking and put on the mask.

Shortly after Chinese New Year, Hong Kong people stopped travelling due to memories of SARS, resulting in Cathay and Dragonair parking aircraft and most pilots and cabin crew being grounded for over one year.

While beginning to wear out my Xbox controller playing COD, I also began devoting more time to investing properly, trying to learn how to trade futures [(Thanks Sven)][df6], trying to learn Cantonese, and consuming [Real Vision][df5] content.

My good friend on the same investing journey suggested we buy some bitcoin from a local OTC exchange.  I decided to follow his lead and got my first chunk of BTC in the $6k range.  Thanks Sean!

## The Crypto Rabbit Hole - Short Version


- BTC OTC -> too expensive for smaller amounts -> What is a more cost effective way?
- Binance P2P for funding, Binance for trading -> More spot BTC and now some ETH
- APIs, sub-accounts, and rebalancing
- LP'ing, staking, futures trading ☢..., and back to hodling
- More APIs, AI Bot futures trading
- YouTube, more Real Vision, Twitter! -> ShardiB - iykyk
- Twitter shit coins
- Twitter THORChain
- BTC Node, LN Node
- Twitter Terra and Luna
- Futures again, but a little more strategically
- Accumulating good new projects
- NFTs - I've got a couple LunaBulls, the THORChain hoodie is my fav
- and once again Twitter, with a [tweet][df7] from @terra_money that really caught my eye
- Email of the year! (see below)
- Today -> GitHub?, Pull Requests?, Java SDK?, Python Std Library, Markup? 😨
 
From the Role Description listed:

>As an Intern in Validator Relations you will:
>Develop a short term goal, and be held accountable to it’s completion. Successful, or unsuccessful.
>Plan, and execute a public course on Node setup (twitter spaces, discord voice, or other open forums)
>Assist the Public Relations Team
>Assist the Validator Relations Team
>Work 10-15 flexible hours per week
>Write weekly reviews of your progress, and learning

>You will find it easier to do your job if you have the following qualities. Needless to say, none of these qualities supersede your intellectual and professional curiosity:
>Proficient in written English, and comfortable with technical language
>Comfortable with simultaneously managing multiple contexts and communication streams
>Familiarity with DevOps terminology and practices
>Familiarity with running software Cosmos-SDK, Tendermint
>Have some experience setting up and running a Terra node

Dodged the first bullet

>Applicant,
>Thank you for applying to Terraform Labs. You have been selected for a first round interview. My name is Xxxxx, and on behalf of Terraform Labs congratulations on making it this far!
>For some this process will be very quick, you will be rejected after your first interview. For some this will be longer, up to 3mo or more months, as multiple engineers vet your application.
>For those that make it to the end, working at Terraform Labs is a once in a lifetime experience.
>We are doing nothing short of changing the world. We expect that our employees will share this motivation. Singularly focused on advancing UST. Our employees are team oriented, and individually driven. Our interview process reflects this philosophy. You are asked to create a pull request to a Terraform Labs GitHub repository of your choice.
>The minimum expectation is a meaningful contribution to the Python or Java SDK. We need living documentation to drive successful adoption. This is something all employees will be expected to contribute to. If this is the wrong place for you to improve documentation, explain your plan in a one on one prior to submission. There is no wrong answer.
>The maximum effort that should be put forward is 2-3hrs of work on a new project, or improvement to the Terra CORE. The PR should include: a well formatted request, a readme page explaining your thought process, a meaningful improvement to the current repo, and a tag @#####-####
>Not all requests will be merged. Before you begin it is suggested that you set up a 15m introduction meeting with me to discuss your plan. After completion you may chose a 15m, 30m, or 60m meeting to review your PR. We will advance candidates after this stage. This is at your own pace. Though the work product must be sufficient, the most important part of this interview process is how you chose to navigate it.
>Appointments: https://calendly.com/#####
>Email address: #####@terra.money
>Thank you for your time



As part of the discovery process into trying to formulate a response to the interview task that I was given, I have had to digest many new terms, definitions, languages, and concepts. Having zero coding experience (Grade 9 BASIC doesn't count), I had to figure out a way that would hopefully make you consider advancing my application. So here we are!

After spending some time to consider my options and realizing that there would be very little chance for me to learn Python by Saturday, then be skilled enough with my new-found language to detect an issue and contribute some new code I felt I would focus on the challenge presented and my non-programming skills so I reverted my attention to the Role Discription where I have many more transferrable skills. Goal oriented, planning, PR, flexible work hours, documenting progress and learnings, curiosity, task management, problem-solver, leadership and conflict resolution.  Now we are talking.

Much like my initial crypto journey, I learn by experimenting, tinkering and doing. Today I've opened a GitHub account (I've got receipts!), kind of used Markdown, watched some YouTube, and developed some new skills, however rudimentary they might be.

-> Holding email sent to Xxxxx@terra.money - time to digest and consider how to approach the pull request.

## Pull Request
I'm learning as I go here.
What better way then to use my own GitHub document.

On the Terra Docs webpage [ DOCS // HOW TO // REGISTER YOUR TERRA VALIDATOR](https://docs.terra.money/How-to/Manage-a-Terra-validator/Set-up-valid[ator.html#confirm-your-validator-is-active)  I would create a pull request by following the link [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/terra-money/docs/edit/main/docs/How-to/Manage-a-Terra-validator/Set-up-validator.md) which brings me to a new page in GitHub.

(to do  list)
- read other pull requests
- find a suggested change to make
- document the change and follow the tasks in the email.




## _Conclusion_

While this might have gone over the 2-3 hours specified, I felt that sharing my thought process and documenting how I completed the interview task would allow you to see how I could create value for Terraform Labs.  The worst case scenario is this document ends up on some lunchroom wall, or a blog titled "How Not to Interview".

I'll finish off by saying that I am obviously a strong believer in Terraform Labs and the potential that it brings to the industry.  The more content I consume the more understand the potential opportunities. I am an active staker of LUNA, a user of UST, and have been using ANC.  I'm also going through the white papers of many of the new protocols being released, and am looking forward to using some of the ones that will make my holdings more liquid, more useful, more decentralized , and simpler to use.

I would be happy if you would consider me for the next phase of the interview process.  
If not, perhaps Do or Terraform Labs needs a pilot!

Regards
Colin
