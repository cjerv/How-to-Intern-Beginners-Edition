## Flying

- Learnt to fly in Cessna 152, Cessna 172, and Piper Seminole PA-44
- After earning my Commercial Pilot License I became a Flight Instructor
- Moved from Instructing to flying a Boeing 727 in various roles
- Moved to Hong Kong and started flying for Cathay Pacific
- I'm currently a Boeing 747 Captain, and I previously flew Airbus A330, A340 and Boeing 777 aircraft.

Flying was something that I wanted to do as a young child, so I am blessed to have been able to achieve that dream.

As [Leonardo Da Vinci] was quoted, and found on the [Pilot Mall Blog][df2]

> “Once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, and there you will always long to return.”


## Markdown - I'm just going to leave this in...

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.
- Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
- Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
- Import and......  OK, that's enough of that

I am unabashedly copying the landing page from [Dillinger][df2].




## My First Coin


Chinese New Year 2020, was when I first realized that my aviation career might be derailed, more specifically January 27th.  Prior to heading off to Singapore, Bangkok, and Singapore, for a 4 night 3 day all expenses paid tour of SE Asia, I recall my wife handing me face masks and insisting that I wear them when walking though the busy airport terminals. I choose to politely thank her, put the masks in my pocket and forget about them. Once we got into the terminal and mixed with many coughing transit passengers heading to Singapore for the holiday, I quickly change my thinking and put on the mask.

[See photo][df3] - Not sure how to insert a photo inline from GitHub into the document. [Syntax Guide for later][df4] (There is a time limit I'm attempting to honor)
figured it out...

![IMG_4619](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93710516/140651712-3d944161-a83d-4e2d-ae9f-fcb62b13ca75.jpg)



Shortly after Chinese New Year, the Hong Kong public stopped travelling due to memories of SARS, and the government imposing restictions, resulting in Cathay and Dragonair parking aircraft and grounding many of its pilots and cabin crew.

After wearing out my Xbox controller playing COD, I began devoting more time to investing properly, trying to learn how to trade futures [(Thanks Sven)][df6], trying to expand my Cantonese, and consuming [Real Vision][df5] content.

A good friend on similar investing journey suggested we buy some bitcoin from a local OTC exchange.  I decided to follow his lead and got my first chunk of BTC in the $6k range.  Thanks Sean!

## The Crypto Rabbit Hole - Short Version


- BTC OTC -> too expensive for smaller amounts -> What is a more cost effective way?
- Binance P2P for funding, Binance for trading -> More spot BTC and now some ETH
- APIs, sub-accounts, and rebalancing
- LP'ing, staking, futures trading ☢..., and back to hodling
- More APIs, AI Bot futures trading
- YouTube, more Real Vision, Twitter! -> ShardiB - iykyk
- Twitter shit coins
- Twitter THORChain
- BTC Node, LN Node
- Twitter Terra and Luna
- Futures again, but a little more strategically
- Accumulating hopefully good new projects
- NFTs - I've got a couple LunaBulls, the THORChain hoodie is my fav
- and once again Twitter, with a [tweet][df7] from @terra_money that really caught my eye
- Email of the year! (see below)
- Today -> GitHub?, Pull Requests?, Java SDK?, Python Std Library, Markup? 😨
 
## The Tweet and Job Description

(insert Pic)![PNG image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93710516/140651160-9aaf4d96-6278-48b2-b8aa-55289ea28ed6.png)


Role Description:

>As an Intern in Validator Relations you will:
>Develop a short term goal, and be held accountable to it’s completion. Successful, or unsuccessful.
>Plan, and execute a public course on Node setup (twitter spaces, discord voice, or other open forums)
>Assist the Public Relations Team
>Assist the Validator Relations Team
>Work 10-15 flexible hours per week
>Write weekly reviews of your progress, and learning

>You will find it easier to do your job if you have the following qualities. Needless to say, none of these qualities supersede your intellectual and professional curiosity:
>Proficient in written English, and comfortable with technical language
>Comfortable with simultaneously managing multiple contexts and communication streams
>Familiarity with DevOps terminology and practices
>Familiarity with running software Cosmos-SDK, Tendermint
>Have some experience setting up and running a Terra node

Dodged the first bullet

>Applicant,
>Thank you for applying to Terraform Labs. You have been selected for a first round interview. My name is Xxxxx, and on behalf of Terraform Labs congratulations on making it this far!
>For some this process will be very quick, you will be rejected after your first interview. For some this will be longer, up to 3mo or more months, as multiple engineers vet your application.
>For those that make it to the end, working at Terraform Labs is a once in a lifetime experience.
>We are doing nothing short of changing the world. We expect that our employees will share this motivation. Singularly focused on advancing UST. Our employees are team oriented, and individually driven. Our interview process reflects this philosophy. You are asked to create a pull request to a Terraform Labs GitHub repository of your choice.
>The minimum expectation is a meaningful contribution to the Python or Java SDK. We need living documentation to drive successful adoption. This is something all employees will be expected to contribute to. If this is the wrong place for you to improve documentation, explain your plan in a one on one prior to submission. There is no wrong answer.
>The maximum effort that should be put forward is 2-3hrs of work on a new project, or improvement to the Terra CORE. The PR should include: a well formatted request, a readme page explaining your thought process, a meaningful improvement to the current repo, and a tag @#####-####
>Not all requests will be merged. Before you begin it is suggested that you set up a 15m introduction meeting with me to discuss your plan. After completion you may chose a 15m, 30m, or 60m meeting to review your PR. We will advance candidates after this stage. This is at your own pace. Though the work product must be sufficient, the most important part of this interview process is how you chose to navigate it.
>Appointments: https://calendly.com/#####
>Email address: #####@terra.money
>Thank you for your time



As part of the discovery process into trying to formulate a response to the interview task that I was given, I have had to digest many new terms, definitions, languages, and concepts. Having zero coding experience (Grade 9 BASIC doesn't count), I had to figure out a way that would hopefully make you consider advancing my application. So here we are!

After spending some time to consider my options and realizing that there would be very little chance for me to learn Python in a week, then be skilled enough with my new-found language to detect an issue and contribute some new code. I decided I would focus on the challenge presented, disregard my programming abilities, and revert my attention to the Role Discription where I have many more transferrable skills. Goal oriented, planning, PR, flexible work hours, documenting progress and learnings, curiosity, task management, problem-solver, leadership and conflict resolution.  Now we are talking.

Much like my initial crypto journey, I learn by experimenting and doing - "Play to Learn", and by teaching - be it my family, close friends, or on Telegram chat groups. I've opened a GitHub account (I've got receipts!), kind of used Markdown, watched some YouTube, and developed some new skills, however rudimentary they might be.

-> Holding email sent to Xxxxx@xxxxx.xxxxx - time to digest and consider how to approach the pull request.

I've also spent some time looking at how GitHub works, While doing this I have found a specific example of a pull request. Feeling discouraged as this  [Pull Request and Tag JW][df8]: 
>"Fix several problems in the commands file and add terrad tx staking subcommands to the subcommands file" 

is beyond me! 

I can't see there being any "good first issues" for me anytime soon.  I've also probably mentally miscast a Steven from TerraLabs as an Intern candidate as well.

## The Pull Request

V1 and V2 were far too complicated, messy, and amateur. This whole "learning as you go" program is probably wearing out anyone who has a clue what they are doing...

So back to YouTube to find a less complicated explaination of a Pull Request.

### The Pull Request V3... 

I've decided to setup a Validator profile

From the Terra Money Validator profiles link [github.com/terra-money/validator-profiles][df10] select a profile that you want to copy. 
I've choosen the Terra-Firma page.
Select the "copy raw contents" link

![2021-11-09 (6)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93710516/140789271-8477b655-07ff-4224-8cb9-e17994269610.png)

In your own file, paste the data and edit! Easy

You could also follow the detailed steps listed at the bottom of this page - [github.com/terra-money/validator-profiles][df10]

Still need to figure out how to resize photos...

To do list:
1) Purchase a domain name from gandi.net - wagbl.io is available for $32
2) Set up a custom domain email address in Protonmail
3) Get a Twitter handle with the new email info@wagbl.io
4) Get a Discord handle
5) Setup a Medium page



## _Conclusion_

While this might have gone slightly over the 2-3 hours specified, I felt that sharing my thought process and documenting how I completed the interview task would allow you to see how I could create value for Terraform Labs.  The worst case scenario is this document ends up on some lunchroom wall, or a blog titled "How Not to Interview".

I will acknowledge that I currently don't have any coding ability. What I do have is a strong desire to grow, a keen curiosity, a willingness to be learn, and understanding that I will be wrong. I have no problem being the dumbest guy in the room, as it allows me to grow.

If we reflect back to the Role Description, and the documentation on  [docs.terra.money/How-to/Manage-a-Terra-validator/Set-up-validator][df9], I know I can complete these objectives:
>Develop a short term goal, and be held accountable to it’s completion. Successful, or unsuccessful.
>Plan, and execute a public course on Node setup (twitter spaces, discord voice, or other open forums)
>Assist the Public Relations Team
>Assist the Validator Relations Team
>Work 10-15 flexible hours per week
>Write weekly reviews of your progress, and learning

One of the biggest skills you learn while flying is the ability to communicate with people.  Nearly every flight at a large airline could you meet someone new. We are tasked with taking the aircraft to its destination safely, legally, and efficiently.  My co-pilots could be from nearly any country, range from just past 20 to 65 in age, and might not speak english as a native language. This will allow me to assist the Public Relations Team and Validator Relations Team, and hopefully this document demonstrates a rough draft of the first part of my future public course!
  
I'll finish off by saying that I am obviously a strong believer in Terraform Labs and the potential that it is creating.  The more information I consume, the more understand the potential opportunities. I am an active staker of LUNA, hold UST, and have been using Anchor Protocol.  I'm also going through the white papers of many of the new protocols being released and interacting with their apps. I am looking forward to using some of the ones that will make my holdings more decentralized, more liquid, more valuable, and more functional. 

Being able to take on this project will allow me to grow my own knowledge and distill the experience and learnings into something that I could share.

I would be happy if you would consider me for the next phase of the interview process.  
If not, perhaps Terraform Labs needs a pilot!

Regards
Colin
